1. Write a Python program to check whether two given circles (given center (x,y) and radius) are intersecting. Return true for intersecting otherwise false.
Sample Output:
True
False

2. Write a Python program to compute the digit distance between two integers.
The digit distance between two numbers is the absolute value of the difference of those numbers.
For example, the distance between 3 and -3 on the number line given by the |3 - (-3) | = |3 + 3 | = 6 units
Digit distance of 123 and 256 is
Since |1 - 2| + |2 - 5| + |3 - 6| = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7
Sample Output:
7
6
1
11

3. Write a Python program to reverse all the words which have even length.
Sample Output:
7
6
1
11

4. Write a Python program to print letters from the English alphabet from a-z and A-Z.
Sample Output:
Alphabet from a-z:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
Alphabet from A-Z:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

5. Write a Python program to generate and prints a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
Sample Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']

6. Write a Python program to identify nonprime numbers between 1 to 100 (integers). Print the nonprime numbers.
Sample Output:
Nonprime numbers between 1 to 100:
4
6
8
9
10
..
96
98
99
100

7. Write a Python program to make a request to a web page, and test the status code, also display the html code of the specified web page.
Sample Output:
Web page status: <Response [200]>
HTML code of the above web page:

Sample Output:
Main line
module name: __main__
parent process: 23967
process id: 27986
function f
module name: __main__
parent process: 27986
process id: 27987

9. Write a Python program to check if two given numbers are coprime or not. Return True if two numbers are coprime otherwise return false.
Sample Output:
True
True
False
False
