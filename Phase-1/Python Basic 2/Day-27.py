1. Write a Python program to find the name of the oldest student from a given dictionary containing the names and ages of a group of students.
Sample Output:
Nidia Dominique
Becki Saunder

2. Write a Python program to create a new string with no duplicate consecutive letters from a given string.
Sample Output:
PYTHON
Python
Java
PHP

3. Write a Python program to check whether two given lines are parallel or not.
Note: Parallel lines are two or more lines that never intersect. Parallel Lines are like railroad tracks that never intersect.
The General Form of the equation of a straight line is: ax + by = c
The said straight line is represented in a list as [a, b, c]
Example of two parallel lines:
x + 4y = 10 and x + 4y = 14
Sample Output:
True
False

4. Write a Python program to create a list of the accumulating sum from a given list.
Sample Output:
[1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
[-1, -3, -6, -10, -15]
[2, 6, 12, 20, 30]

5. Write a Python program to check whether a given sequence is linear, quadratic or cubic.
Sequences are sets of numbers that are connected in some way.
Linear sequence:
A number pattern which increases or decreases by the same amount each time is called a linear sequence. The amount it increases or decreases by is known as the common difference.
Quadratic sequence:
In quadratic sequence, the difference between each term increases, or decreases, at a constant rate.
Cubic sequence:
Sequences where the 3rd difference are known as cubic sequence.
Sample Output:
Linear Sequence
Quadratic Sequence
Cubic Sequence
Linear Sequence

6. Write a Python program to test whether a given integer is pandigital number or not.
From Wikipedia,
In mathematics, a pandigital number is an integer that in a given base has among its significant digits each digit used in the base at least once.
For example,
1223334444555556666667777777888888889999999990 is a pandigital number in base 10.
The first few pandigital base 10 numbers are given by:
1023456789, 1023456798, 1023456879, 1023456897, 1023456978, 1023456987, 1023457689
Sample Output:
True
True
True
True
False

7. Write a Python program to check whether a given number is Oddish or Evenish.
A number is called "Oddish" if the sum of all of its digits is odd, and a number is called "Evenish" if the sum of all of its digits is even.
Sample Output:
Oddish
Evenish
Oddish
Evenish
Oddish

8. Write a Python program that takes three integers and check whether the last digit of first number * the last digit of second number = the last digit of third number.
Sample Output:
True
True
True
False
False

9. Write a Python program find the indices of all occurrences of a given item in a given list.
Sample Output:
[1, 5]
[0, 3, 7, 8]
[3, 6]

10. Write a Python program to remove two duplicate numbers from a given number of list.
Sample Output:
[1, 4, 5]
[1, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
