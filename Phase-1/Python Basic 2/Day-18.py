1. Write a Python program to check the sum of three elements (each from an array) from three arrays is equal to a target value. Print all those three-element combinations.
   Sample data:
   /*
   X = [10, 20, 20, 20]
   Y = [10, 20, 30, 40]
   Z = [10, 30, 40, 20]
   target = 70
   */

2. Write a Python program to create all possible permutations from a given collection of distinct numbers

3. Write a Python program to get all possible two digit letter combinations from a digit (1 to 9) string.
   string_maps = {
   "1": "abc",
   "2": "def",
   "3": "ghi",
   "4": "jkl",
   "5": "mno",
   "6": "pqrs",
   "7": "tuv",
   "8": "wxy",
   "9": "z"
   }

4. Write a Python program to add two positive integers without using the '+' operator.
Note: Use bit wise operations to add two numbers.

5. Write a Python program to check the priority of the four operators (+, -, *, /).

6. Write a Python program to get the third side of right angled triangle from two given sides.

7. Write a Python program to get all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length n.
A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. In other words, the numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down (e.g., 69, 96, 1001).
For example,
Given n = 2, return ["11", "69", "88", "96"].
Given n = 3, return ['818', '111', '916', '619', '808', '101', '906', '609', '888', '181', '986', '689']

8. Write a Python program to find the median among three given numbers.

9. Write a Python program to find the value of n where n degrees of number 2 are written sequentially in a line without spaces.

10. Write a Python program to find the number of zeros at the end of a factorial of a given positive number.
Range of the number(n): (1 = n = 2*109).
