1. Write a Python program to find the number of notes (Sample of notes: 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 ) against a given amount.
Range - Number of notes(n) : n (1 = n = 1000000).
 
2. Write a Python program to create a sequence where the first four members of the sequence are equal to one, and each successive term of the sequence is equal to the sum of the four previous ones. Find the Nth member of the sequence.

3. Write a Python program that accept a positive number and subtract from this number the sum of its digits and so on. Continues this operation until the number is positive.

4. Write a Python program to find the number of divisors of a given integer is even or odd.

5. Write a Python program to find the digits which are absent in a given mobile number.

6. Write a Python program to compute the summation of the absolute difference of all distinct pairs in an given array (non-decreasing order).
Sample array: [1, 2, 3]
Then all the distinct pairs will be:
1 2
1 3
2 3

7. Write a Python program to find the type of the progression (arithmetic progression/geometric progression) and the next successive member of a given three successive members of a sequence.
According to Wikipedia, an arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer.
On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer.

8. Write a Python program to print the length of the series and the series from the given 3rd term, 3rd last term and the sum of a series.
Sample Data:
Input third term of the series: 3
Input 3rd last term: 3
Sum of the series: 15
Length of the series: 5
Series:
1 2 3 4 5

9. Write a Python program to find common divisors between two numbers in a given pair.

10. Write a Python program to reverse the digits of a given number and add it to the original, If the sum is not a palindrome repeat this procedure.
Note: A palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.
