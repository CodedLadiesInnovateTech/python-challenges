"""
1. Write a Python program to randomly generate a list with 10 even numbers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
Note: Use random.sample() to generate a list of random values.
Sample Output:
[4, 22, 8, 20, 24, 12, 30, 98, 28, 48]

2. Write a Python program to calculate the median from a list of numbers.
Sample Output:
3
3.5
3.5
3.75
3.3
22.3

3. Write a Python program to test whether a given number is symmetrical or not.
A number is symmetrical when it is equal of its reverse.
Sample Output:
True
True
False
True

4. Write a Python program that accept a list of numbers and create a list to store the count of negative number in first element and store the sum of positive numbers in second element.
Sample Output:
[0, 15]
[5, 0]
[2, 6]
[3, 3]

5. From Wikipedia:
An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a logological term for a word or phrase without a repeating letter. It is also used by some people to mean a word or phrase in which each letter appears the same number of times, not necessarily just once. Conveniently, the word itself is an isogram in both senses of the word, making it autological.
Write a Python program to check whether a given string is an "isogram" or not.
Sample Output:
False
True
True
False

6. Write a Python program to count the number of equal numbers from three given integers.
Sample Output:
3
2
0
3

7. Write a Python program to check whether a given employee code is exactly 8 digits or 12 digits. Return True if the employee code is valid and False if it's not.
Sample Output:
True
False
False
True
False

8. Write a Python program that accept two strings and test if the letters in the second string are present in the first string.
Sample Output:
True
False
True
False
True

9. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the three lowest positive numbers from a given list of numbers.
Sample Output:
37
6
6

10. Write a Python program to replace all but the last five characters of a given string into "*" and returns the new masked string.
Sample Output:
******23swe
******bcdef
12345
