5. There are two circles C1 with radius r1, central coordinate (x1, y1) and C2 with radius r2 and central coordinate (x2, y2).
Write a Python program to test the followings -
"C2 is in C1" if C2 is in C1
"C1 is in C2" if C1 is in C2
"Circumference of C1 and C2 intersect" if circumference of C1 and C2 intersect, and
"C1 and C2 do not overlap" if C1 and C2 do not overlap.
Input:
Input numbers (real numbers) are separated by a space.

5 6 4 8 7 9
C1 is in C2

6. Write a Python program to that reads a date (from 2016/1/1 to 2016/12/31) and prints the day of the date. Jan. 1, 2016, is Friday. Note that 2016 is a leap year.
Input:
Two integers m and d separated by a single space in a line, m ,d represent the month and the day.
Input month and date (separated by a single space):
5 15
Name of the date: Sunday

7. Write a Python program which reads a text (only alphabetical characters and spaces.) and prints two words. The first one is the word which is arise most frequently in the text. The second one is the word which has the maximum number of letters.
Note: A word is a sequence of letters which is separated by the spaces.
Input:
A text is given in a line with following condition:
a. The number of letters in the text is less than or equal to 1000.
b. The number of letters in a word is less than or equal to 32.
c. There is only one word which is arise most frequently in given text.
d. There is only one word which has the maximum number of letters in given text.
Input text: Thank you for your comment and your participation.
Output: your participation.

8. Write a Python program that reads n digits (given) chosen from 0 to 9 and prints the number of combinations where the sum of the digits equals to another given number (s). Do not use the same digits in a combination.
Input:
Two integers as number of combinations and their sum by a single space in a line. Input 0 0 to exit.
Input number of combinations and sum, input 0 0 to exit:
5 6
2 4
0 0
2

9. Write a Python program which reads the two adjoined sides and the diagonal of a parallelogram and check whether the parallelogram is a rectangle or a rhombus.
According to Wikipedia-
parallelograms: In Euclidean geometry, a parallelogram is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure.
rectangles: In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. It can also be defined as an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360째/4 = 90째). It can also be defined as a parallelogram containing a right angle.
rhombus: In plane Euclidean geometry, a rhombus (plural rhombi or rhombuses) is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus is often called a diamond, after the diamonds suit in playing cards which resembles the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60째 angle, and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45째 angle.
Input:
Two adjoined sides and the diagonal.
1 = ai, bi, ci = 1000, ai + bi > ci
Input two adjoined sides and the diagonal of a parallelogram (comma separated):
3,4,5
This is a rectangle.

10. Write a Python program to replace a string "Python" with "Java" and "Java" with "Python" in a given string.
Input:
