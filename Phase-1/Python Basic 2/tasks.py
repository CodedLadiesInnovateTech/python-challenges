27. Write a Python program to find the type of the progression (arithmetic progression/geometric progression) and the next successive member of a given three successive members of a sequence.
According to Wikipedia, an arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer.
On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer.

31. Write a Python program to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition problems.
According to Wikipedia " In elementary arithmetic, a carry is a digit that is transferred from one column of digits to another column of more significant digits. It is part of the standard algorithm to add numbers together by starting with the rightmost digits and working to the left. For example, when 6 and 7 are added to make 13, the "3" is written to the same column and the "1" is carried to the left".

49. Write a Python program which reads the two adjoined sides and the diagonal of a parallelogram and check whether the parallelogram is a rectangle or a rhombus.
According to Wikipedia-
parallelograms: In Euclidean geometry, a parallelogram is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure.
rectangles: In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. It can also be defined as an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360°/4 = 90°). It can also be defined as a parallelogram containing a right angle.
rhombus: In plane Euclidean geometry, a rhombus (plural rhombi or rhombuses) is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus is often called a diamond, after the diamonds suit in playing cards which resembles the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60° angle, and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45° angle.

Goldbach number: A Goldbach number is a positive even integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.[4] Since four is the only even number greater than two that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the sum of two primes, another form of the statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all even integers greater than 4 are Goldbach numbers.
The expression of a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach partition of that number. The following are examples of Goldbach partitions for some even numbers:
6 = 3 + 3
8 = 3 + 5
10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5
12 = 7 + 5

65. In mathematics, a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence (A,B,D) is a subsequence of (A,B,C,D,E,F) obtained after removal of elements C, E, and F. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a preorder.
The subsequence should not be confused with substring (A,B,C,D) which can be derived from the above string (A,B,C,D,E,F) by deleting substring (E,F). The substring is a refinement of the subsequence.
The list of all subsequences for the word "apple" would be "a", "ap", "al", "ae", "app", "apl", "ape", "ale", "appl", "appe", "aple", "apple", "p", "pp", "pl", "pe", "ppl", "ppe", "ple", "pple", "l", "le", "e", "".

85. From Wikipedia:
An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a logological term for a word or phrase without a repeating letter. It is also used by some people to mean a word or phrase in which each letter appears the same number of times, not necessarily just once. Conveniently, the word itself is an isogram in both senses of the word, making it autological.
Write a Python program to check whether a given string is an "isogram" or not.

Sample Output:

96. Write a Python program to check whether a given number is a narcissistic number or not.

If you are a reader of Greek mythology, then you are probably familiar with Narcissus. He was a hunter of exceptional beauty that he died because he was unable to leave a pool after falling in love with his own reflection. That's why I keep myself away from pools these days (kidding).
In mathematics, he has kins by the name of narcissistic numbers - numbers that can't get enough of themselves. In particular, they are numbers that are the sum of their digits when raised to the power of the number of digits.
For example, 371 is a narcissistic number; it has three digits, and if we cube each digits 33 + 73 + 13 the sum is 371. Other 3-digit narcissistic numbers are
153 = 13 + 53 + 33
370 = 33 + 73 + 03
407 = 43 + 03 + 73.
There are also 4-digit narcissistic numbers, some of which are 1634, 8208, 9474 since
1634 = 14+64+34+44
8208 = 84+24+04+84
9474 = 94+44+74+44
It has been proven that there are only 88 narcissistic numbers (in the decimal system) and that the largest of which is
115,132,219,018,763,992,565,095,597,973,971,522,401
has 39 digits.
