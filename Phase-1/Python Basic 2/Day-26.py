1. Write a Python program to count the number of arguments in a given function.
Sample Output:
0
1
2
3
4
1

2. Write a Python program to compute cumulative sum of numbers of a given list.
Note: Cumulative sum = sum of itself + all previous numbers in the said list.
Sample Output:
[10, 30, 60, 100, 150, 210, 217]
[1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15]

3. Write a Python program to find the middle character(s) of a given string. If the length of the string is odd return the middle character and return the middle two characters if the string length is even.
Sample Output:
th
H
av

4. Write a Python program to find the largest product of the pair of adjacent elements from a given list of integers.
Sample Output:
30
20
6

5. Write a Python program to check whether every even index contains an even number and every odd index contains odd number of a given list.
Sample Output:
True
False
True

6. Write a Python program to check whether a given number is a narcissistic number or not.
If you are a reader of Greek mythology, then you are probably familiar with Narcissus. He was a hunter of exceptional beauty that he died because he was unable to leave a pool after falling in love with his own reflection. That's why I keep myself away from pools these days (kidding).
In mathematics, he has kins by the name of narcissistic numbers - numbers that can't get enough of themselves. In particular, they are numbers that are the sum of their digits when raised to the power of the number of digits.
For example, 371 is a narcissistic number; it has three digits, and if we cube each digits 33 + 73 + 13 the sum is 371. Other 3-digit narcissistic numbers are
153 = 13 + 53 + 33
370 = 33 + 73 + 03
407 = 43 + 03 + 73.
There are also 4-digit narcissistic numbers, some of which are 1634, 8208, 9474 since
1634 = 14+64+34+44
8208 = 84+24+04+84
9474 = 94+44+74+44
It has been proven that there are only 88 narcissistic numbers (in the decimal system) and that the largest of which is
115,132,219,018,763,992,565,095,597,973,971,522,401
has 39 digits.

9. Write a Python program to find the position of the second occurrence of a given string in another given string. If there is no such string return -1.
Sample Output:
-1
31

10. Write a Python program to compute the sum of all items of a given array of integers where each integer is multiplied by its index. Return 0 if there is no number.
Sample Output:
