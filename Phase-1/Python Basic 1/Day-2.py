"""

Target for today are:

1. Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output-1)
    'Sample String : "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high,
     Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are"'
    Tools: print function
2. Write a Python program to get the Python version you are using
    Tools: sys module
3. Write a Python program to display the current date and time.
    Sample Output :
        Current date and time : 2014-07-05 14:34:14
    Tools: Datetime module
4. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.
    Sample Output :
        r = 1.1
        Area = 3.8013271108436504
    Tools: input function

5. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.
    Tools: input function, list slicing

6. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
        Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
        Output :
        List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23']
        Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')
    Tools: input function, list, tuple


7. Write a Python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that.
        Sample filename : abc.java
        Output : java
    Tools: input function, slicing


8. Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list.
        color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]
    Tools: list slicing,indexing


9. Write a Python program to display the examination schedule. (extract the date from exam_st_date).
        exam_st_date = (11, 12, 2014)
        Sample Output : The examination will start from : 11 / 12 / 2014
    Tools:slicing,indexing


10. Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn.
        Sample value of n is 5
        Expected Result : 615
    Tools: input function, maths
