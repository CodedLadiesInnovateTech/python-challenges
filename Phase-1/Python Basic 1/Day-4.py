1. Write a Python program to find whether a given number (accept from the user) is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

2. Write a Python program to count the number 4 in a given list.

3. Write a Python program to get the n (non-negative integer) copies of the first 2 characters of a given string. Return the n copies of the whole string if the length is less than 2.

4. Write a Python program to test whether a passed letter is a vowel or not.

5. Write a Python program to check whether a specified value is contained in a group of values.
Test Data :
3 -> [1, 5, 8, 3] : True
-1 -> [1, 5, 8, 3] : False

6. Write a Python program to create a histogram from a given list of integers.

7. Write a Python program to concatenate all elements in a list into a string and return it.

8. Write a Python program to print all even numbers from a given numbers list in the same order and stop the printing if any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence.
Sample numbers list :
numbers = [    
    386, 462, 47, 418, 907, 344, 236, 375, 823, 566, 597, 978, 328, 615, 953, 345,

    958,743, 527
    ]

9. Write a Python program to print out a set containing all the colors from color_list_1 which are not present in color_list_2.
Test Data :
color_list_1 = set(["White", "Black", "Red"])
color_list_2 = set(["Red", "Green"])
Expected Output :
{'Black', 'White'}
