1. Write a Python program to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

2. Write a Python program to get the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers.

3. Write a Python program to sum of three given integers. However, if two values are equal sum will be zero.

4. Write a Python program to sum of two given integers. However, if the sum is between 15 to 20 it will return 20.

5. Write a Python program that will return true if the two given integer values are equal or their sum or difference is 5.

6. Write a Python program to add two objects if both objects are an integer type.

7. Write a Python program to display your details like name, age, address in three different lines.

8. Write a Python program to solve (x + y) * (x + y).
Test Data : x = 4, y = 3
Expected Output : (4 + 3) ^ 2) = 49

9. Write a Python program to compute the future value of a specified principal amount, rate of interest, and a number of years.
