Data Structures and Algorithms: Recursion[ 11 exercises]

1. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.


2. Write a Python program to converting an Integer to a string in any base.


3. Write a Python program of recursion list sum.
Test Data: [1, 2, [3,4], [5,6]]
Expected Result: 21


4. Write a Python program to get the factorial of a non-negative integer.


5. Write a Python program to solve the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.


6. Write a Python program to get the sum of a non-negative integer.
Test Data:
sumDigits(345) -> 12
sumDigits(45) -> 9


7. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of the positive integers of n+(n-2)+(n-4)... (until n-x =< 0).
Test Data:
sum_series(6) -> 12
sum_series(10) -> 30


8. Write a Python program to calculate the harmonic sum of n-1.
Note: The harmonic sum is the sum of reciprocals of the positive integers.
Example : A harmonic series: 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+........


9. Write a Python program to calculate the geometric sum of n-1.
Note: In mathematics, a geometric series is a series with a constant ratio between successive terms.
Example :A harmonic series: 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5........



10. Write a Python program to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b'.
Test Data :
(power(3,4) -> 81


11. Write a Python program to find  the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers.
