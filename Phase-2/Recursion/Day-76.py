'''
1. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of the positive integers of n+(n-2)+(n-4)... (until n-x =< 0).
Test Data:
sum_series(6) -> 12
sum_series(10) -> 30

2. Write a Python program to calculate the harmonic sum of n-1.
Note: The harmonic sum is the sum of reciprocals of the positive integers.
Example : A harmonic series: 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+........

3. Write a Python program to calculate the geometric sum of n-1.
Note: In mathematics, a geometric series is a series with a constant ratio between successive terms.
Example :A harmonic series: 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5........
