1. Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using Cycle sort.
Cycle sort is an in-place, unstable sorting algorithm, a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array, 
unlike any other in-place sorting algorithm. It is based on the idea that the permutation to be sorted can be factored into cycles, which can individually be rotated 
to give a sorted result.

2. Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using Heap sort.
In computer science, heapsort (invented by J. W. J. Williams in 1964) is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region,
and it interactively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.
The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.
Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case O(n log n) runtime. 
Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort. A run of the heapsort algorithm sorting an array of randomly permuted values.
In the first stage of the algorithm the array elements are reordered to satisfy the heap property. Before the actual sorting takes place, 
the heap tree structure is shown briefly for illustration.

3. Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using Pancake sort.
Pancake sorting is the colloquial term for the mathematical problem of sorting a disordered stack of pancakes in order of size when a spatula can be inserted
at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it. A pancake number is the minimum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes. 
The problem was first discussed by American geometer Jacob E. Goodman. It is a variation of the sorting problem in which the only allowed operation is to
reverse the elements of some prefix of the sequence.
