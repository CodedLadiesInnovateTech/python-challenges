1. Write a Python program to count the number of elements in a list within a specified range. 

2. Write a Python program to check whether a list contains a sublist. 

3. Write a Python program to generate all sublists of a list. 

4. Write a Python program using Sieve of Eratosthenes method for computing primes upto a specified number. 
Note: In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes, (Ancient Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους, kóskinon Eratosthénous) one of a number of prime
number sieves, is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.
 
5. Write a Python program to create a list by concatenating a given list which range goes from 1 to n. 
Sample list : ['p', 'q']
n =5
Sample Output : ['p1', 'q1', 'p2', 'q2', 'p3', 'q3', 'p4', 'q4', 'p5', 'q5']

6. Write a Python program to get variable unique identification number or string. 

7. Write a Python program to find common items from two lists. 

8. Write a Python program to change the position of every n-th value with the (n+1)th in a list. 
Sample list: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
Expected Output: [1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4]

9. Write a Python program to convert a list of multiple integers into a single integer. 
Sample list: [11, 33, 50]
Expected Output: 113350

10. Write a Python program to split a list based on first character of word.
