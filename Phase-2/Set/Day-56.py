1. Write a Python program to create a shallow copy of sets.
Note : Shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object.

2. Write a Python program to clear a set.

3. Write a Python program to use of frozensets.
Note: Frozensets behave just like sets except they are immutable.

4. Write a Python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set.

5. Write a Python program to find the length of a set.

6. Write a Python program to check if a given value is present in a set or not.

7. Write a Python program to check if two given sets have no elements in common.

8. Write a Python program to check if a given set is superset of itself and superset of another given set.

9. Write a Python program to find the elements in a given set that are not in another set.

10. Write a Python program to check a given set has no elements in common with other given set.
