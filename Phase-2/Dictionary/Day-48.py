1. Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.

2. Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.
Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}
Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

3. Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one.
Sample Dictionary :
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}
