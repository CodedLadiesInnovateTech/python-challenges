1. Write a Python program to create an Enum object and display a member name and value.
Sample data :
Afghanistan = 93
Albania = 355
Algeria = 213
Andorra = 376
Angola = 244
Antarctica = 672
Expected Output :
Member name: Albania
Member value: 355

2. Write a Python program to iterate over an enum class and display individual member and their value.
Expected Output:
Afghanistan = 93
Albania = 355
Algeria = 213
Andorra = 376
Angola = 244
Antarctica = 672

3. Write a Python program to display all the member name of an enum class ordered by their values.
Expected Output:
Country Name ordered by Country Code:
Afghanistan
Algeria
Angola
Albania
Andorra
Antarctica

4. Write a Python program to get all values from an enum class.
Expected output:
[93, 355, 213, 376, 244, 672]

5. Write a Python program to count the most common words in a dictionary.
Expected Output:
[('pink', 6), ('black', 5), ('white', 5), ('red', 4)]

6. Write a Python program to find the class wise roll number from a tuple-of-tuples.
Expected Output:
defaultdict(, {'VII': [1], 'V': [1, 2], 'VI': [1, 2, 3]})

7. Write a Python program to count the number of students of individual class.
Sample data:
classes = (
('V', 1),
('VI', 1),
('V', 2),
('VI', 2),
('VI', 3),
('VII', 1),
)
Expected Output:
Counter({'VI': 3, 'V': 2, 'VII': 1})

8.Write a Python program to get the unique enumeration values.
Expected Output:
Afghanistan = 93
Albania = 355
Algeria = 213
Andorra = 376
Angola = 244

9. Write a Python program to create an instance of an OrderedDict using a given dictionary. Sort the dictionary during the creation and print the members of the dictionary in reverse order.
Expected Output:
Angola 244
Andorra 376
Algeria 213
Afghanistan 93
Albania 355
In reverse order:
Albania 355
Afghanistan 93
Algeria 213
Andorra 376
Angola 244

10. Write a Python program to group a sequence of key-value pairs into a dictionary of lists.
Expected output:
[('v', [1, 3]), ('vi', [2, 4]), ('vii', [1])]
