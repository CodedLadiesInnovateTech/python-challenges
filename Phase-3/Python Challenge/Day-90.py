1. Write a Python program to find whether it contains an additive sequence or not.
The additive sequence is a sequence of numbers where the sum of the first two numbers is equal to the third one.
Sample additive sequence: 6, 6, 12, 18, 30
In the above sequence 6 + 6 =12, 6 + 12 = 18, 12 + 18 = 30....
Also, you can split a number into one or more digits to create an additive sequence.
Sample additive sequence: 66121830
In the above sequence 6 + 6 =12, 6 + 12 = 18, 12 + 18 = 30....
Note : Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros.
 
2. Write a Python program to reverse the digits of an integer.
Input : 234
Input : -234
Output: 432
Output : -432

3. Write a Python program to reverse the bits of an integer (32 bits unsigned).
Input : 1234
Output : 1260388352
For example, 1234 represented in binary as 10011010010 and returns 1260388352 which represents in binary as 1001011001000000000000000000000.
