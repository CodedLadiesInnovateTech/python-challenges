1. Write a Python program to check a sequence of numbers is an arithmetic progression or not.
Input : [5, 7, 9, 11]
Output : True
In mathematics, an arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant.
For example, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 ... is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.

2. Write a Python program to check a sequence of numbers is a geometric progression or not.
Input : [2, 6, 18, 54]
Output : True
In mathematics, a geometric progression or geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.
For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.

3. Write a Python program to compute the sum of the two reversed numbers and display the sum in reversed form.
Input : 13, 14
Output : 27
