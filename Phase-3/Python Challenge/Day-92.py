1. Write a Python program where you take any positive integer n, if n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process until you reach 1.
Input : 12
Output : [12, 6.0, 3.0, 10.0, 5.0, 16.0, 8.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0]
According to Wikipedia, the Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics named after Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. The conjecture is also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture.
The conjecture can be summarized as follows. Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process (which has been called "Half Or Triple Plus One") indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.
Example :
For instance, starting with n = 12, one gets the sequence 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
n = 19, for example, takes longer to reach 1: 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

2. Write a Python program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
Input : 12
Output : True
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...
shows the first 10 ugly numbers.
Note: 1 is typically treated as an ugly number

3. Write a Python program to get the Hamming numbers upto a given numbers also check whether a given number is an Hamming number.
Input : 7
Output : 0
Hamming numbers are numbers of the form
H = 2i x 3j x 5k
Where i, j, k = 0
The sequence of Hamming numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27. . . consists of all numbers of the form 2i.3j.5k where i, j and k are non-negative integers.
